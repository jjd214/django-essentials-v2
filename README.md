# 🐍 Django Learning Journey

Welcome to my Django learning repository! This project contains my hands-on exploration and practice as I dive into the world of web development using the **Django** framework.

## 📌 What is Django?

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the **"batteries-included"** philosophy — meaning it comes with a lot of built-in features like user authentication, database management, templating, routing, and more.

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

This repository is part of my journey to learn the following Django fundamentals:

- Setting up a Django project and apps
- Understanding the MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture
- URL routing and views
- Working with models and databases
- Using Django admin
- Creating dynamic templates
- Handling forms and user input
- Managing static files (CSS, images, etc.)
- Basic user authentication
